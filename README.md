# File-Zipper
Java Project

The project implements a file compression utility that reduces the size of files for easier storage or transmission. It uses Huffman Coding, which is a widely-used lossless data compression algorithm, to compress the data. The Greedy Algorithm approach is used in Huffman Coding to construct the most efficient code based on the frequency of characters in the file.
